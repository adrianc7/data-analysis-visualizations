# Global Impact of COVID-19 on Education (2020)

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing how the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted education systems worldwide in 2020.  
It highlights the total number of students affected, the regional and socioeconomic distribution of disruptions, and how school closure statuses varied by country and income level.

## Project Overview
The dashboard visualizes data from the World Bank’s Global Education Monitoring datasets, which track the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on student populations across countries and income groups.  
It reveals the scale of disruption, identifying where and to what extent students were affected by full or partial school closures during the pandemic.
